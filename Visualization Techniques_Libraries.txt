Here are some popular visualization techniques and libraries in Python:

**Visualization Techniques:**

1. **Scatter Plots**: Used to show the relationship between two variables.
2. **Bar Charts**: Used to compare categorical data.
3. **Line Plots**: Used to show trends over time or continuous data.
4. **Heatmaps**: Used to show the relationship between two variables, with color representing the strength of the relationship.
5. **Box Plots**: Used to show the distribution of a single variable.
6. **Violin Plots**: Used to show the distribution of a single variable, with a kernel density estimate.
7. **Pie Charts**: Used to show the proportion of different categories.
8. **Network Visualizations**: Used to show relationships between nodes in a network.

**Python Libraries:**

1. **Matplotlib**: A popular plotting library for creating a wide range of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, and histograms.
2. **Seaborn**: A visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
3. **Plotly**: A library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, and 3D plots.
4. **Bokeh**: A library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, and 3D plots.
5. **Altair**: A library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, and 3D plots.
6. **NetworkX**: A library for creating and analyzing complex networks, including nodes and edges.
7. **Gephi**: A library for creating and analyzing complex networks, including nodes and edges.
8. **Pygal**: A library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, and 3D plots.
